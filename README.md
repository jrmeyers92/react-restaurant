I utilized React and React Router to create a website for a cafe. I'm proud of the css animations and positioning I did to create the dot menu on the right side. 

Next steps for this website is to add transitions when switching pages. 

I am working on getting this website hosted but have been having issues with Githut Pages, Netlify and Vercel.
